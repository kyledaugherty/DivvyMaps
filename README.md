DivvyMaps is a web application that provides optimized directions to Divvy bike riders. The application uses Divvy, Google Distance Matrix and Google Directions APIs to determine optimal routes to and from a Divvy station, and biking directions between two stations. The app also accounts for rides longer than 30 minutes by directing users to multiple check-in stations along their route.
